# MyNCHS 2.0

Made for FBLA Mobile Application Development
By Sai Lalith Kanumuri, Bryan Nie, and Rithin Karthik

## Abstract
MyNCHS is an app for the North Creek High School Community. It holds many different features to help all users extract information on subjects related to our school. The app features many different features, like integrated social media, calendar scheduling, and more, which are either essential features or requirements for FBLA Mobile Application Development submissions. Along with the necessities for an information and productivity app, MyNCHS also provides in-built messaging, to communicate with North Creek personnel. The entirety of the app was built with Xcode, SwiftUI, UIkit, and more platforms, for iPhone and iPad, allowing for a streamlined, and stable app.

## Pages
These are all of the big pages in the app, and information about them.
### Home
The homepage is the gateway to all of the other pages and features of the app. It is clean and organized, to cause little confusion. It uses a system called WebView to view external media inside of the app, for more containment.

### News
The newspage simply keeps the user up to date on official North Creek High School News. The most recent newspapers known as bulletins are listed for anyone to read. Everything is organized by category to minimize confusion.

### Calendar
The calendar in general is a useful and simple way to keep track of events. The simple interface allows users to add, edit and delete events in a pinch. 3 main files, and more smaller ones keep track of the list of events, and the other 2 for adding and deleting events.

### Information
This is similar to News. It gives users information. However, this is achieved through acessing external resources. It uses a few scripts to pull out logos, and make them clickable, as well as WebView. 

### Messages
This is our biggest feature. Users can use this feature to send texts, images, emails, and more. It uses Firebase, and custom code, for things like picking an image from the photo gallery. People can send these things to teachers, or counselors.

## Platforms
- SwiftUI
- UIkit
- Firebase(backend)

Our app is built with a bunch of different platforms. We namely used SwiftUI, UIkit, and Firebase.

SwiftUI is a programming language by Apple to easily make apps for apple devices. A big part of the app was made with this. However, SwiftUI lacks in some areas, so we also used UIkit. UIkit is another platform to make apps easily, and we used this to make our messaging feature. These two platforms are frontended, however.

The solution to that was using Firebase as well. We used Firebase for any backend processing not done solely on the device. We used Firebase to implement Google SSO technology, and to handle messages in our messaging feature.
## Privacy
MyNCHS does not handle any unnecessary data, nor does it share any of that data with third parties. Child Safety guidlines would make data collection a hassle. In the future, MyNCHS may collect substantial amounts of data. However, this data will only be used to make your experience in the app better, through learning what features you use, etc. your data will not be used to send you relevant ads, nor will it be sold to other companies.
## Future Plans
